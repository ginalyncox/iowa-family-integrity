## 🌿 Overview
The **Iowa Family Integrity and Patient Protection Initiative** is a citizen-led effort to ensure that Iowans who lawfully participate in the state’s medical cannabis program are not penalized in custody, foster, or adoption proceedings.  

This project promotes *patient safety, family stability, and respect for Iowa’s sovereignty* through legislative reform, administrative oversight, judicial accountability, and public education.
