## 🌿 Overview
The **Iowa Family Integrity and Patient Protection Initiative** is a citizen-led effort to ensure that Iowans who lawfully participate in the state’s medical cannabis program are not penalized in custody, foster, or adoption proceedings.

This project promotes *patient safety, family stability, and respect for Iowa’s sovereignty* through legislative reform, administrative oversight, judicial accountability, and public education.

## 🏛️ Legislative Goals
1. Protect lawful medical-cannabis patients from discrimination in family or child-welfare decisions.  
2. Clarify that *impairment*, not *presence*, is the standard of parental fitness.  
3. Require Iowa HHS to issue interpretive guidance under Iowa Code § 17A.7.  
4. Encourage the Iowa Supreme Court to reaffirm equal treatment for medical-cannabis patients.

## 🤝 Collaboration & Advocacy Network
The **Iowa Family Integrity and Patient Protection Initiative** is a **citizen-led effort**.  
We welcome collaboration from Iowa-based organizations, healthcare professionals, attorneys, social workers, and patient advocates who believe that no lawful medical patient should lose custody, housing, or opportunity because of their state-approved treatment.

If your organization or practice supports evidence-based reform and family integrity protections, reach out to explore endorsement or coalition alignment.
