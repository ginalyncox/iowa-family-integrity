## Overview

The **Iowa Family Integrity and Patient Protection Initiative** is a **citizen-led effort** to ensure that Iowans who lawfully participate in the state’s medical cannabis program are **not penalized in custody, foster-care, or adoption proceedings.**

This project promotes *patient safety, family stability, and respect for Iowa’s sovereignty* through:

- Legislative reform  
- Administrative oversight (Iowa HHS guidance under Iowa Code § 17A.7)  
- Judicial education and accountability  
- Public awareness and evidence-based training
