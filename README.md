## 🌿 Overview
The **Iowa Family Integrity and Patient Protection Initiative** is a citizen-led effort to ensure that Iowans who lawfully participate in the state’s medical-cannabis program are not penalized in custody, foster, or adoption proceedings.

This initiative promotes **patient safety, family stability, and respect for Iowa’s sovereignty** through legislative reform, administrative oversight, judicial accountability, and public education.

## 🏛️ Legislative Goals
1. **Protect lawful patients** from discrimination in family, custody, or child-welfare decisions.  
2. **Clarify** that *impairment*—not the *mere presence* of THC metabolites—is the valid standard of parental fitness.  
3. **Direct Iowa HHS** to issue interpretive guidance under Iowa Code § 17A.7 ensuring statewide uniformity.  
4. **Encourage judicial consistency** through Iowa Supreme Court acknowledgment of patient protections.

## 🤝 Collaboration & Advocacy Network
The **Iowa Family Integrity and Patient Protection Initiative** is a **citizen-driven advocacy project**.  
We welcome collaboration from Iowa-based organizations, healthcare professionals, attorneys, social workers, and patient advocates who believe that no lawful medical patient should lose custody, housing, or opportunity because of state-approved treatment.

If your organization or practice supports evidence-based reform and family-integrity protections, contact us to explore endorsement or coalition alignment.
