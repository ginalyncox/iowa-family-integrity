    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>The Iowa Family Integrity and Patient Protection Initiative is designed to ensure that Iowa families who lawfully participate in the state‚Äôs medical cannabidiol program under Iowa Code ¬ß124E are not penalized in matters of custody, foster care, or adoption. Currently, gaps between medical and family law have allowed lawful medical-cannabis patients to face disqualification, investigation, or loss of placement rights. This initiative provides a framework for legislative reform, administrative guidance, judicial consistency, and patient confidentiality protections across Iowa‚Äôs child-welfare system.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="background">
    <h2>Background and Rationale</h2>
    <p>Iowa legalized medical cannabidiol through Iowa Code ¬ß124E, permitting licensed physicians to recommend treatment for qualifying patients. However, inconsistent interpretation of this law by courts, child-welfare officials, and healthcare providers has resulted in discrimination against medical patients and their families. Parents and grandparents with valid Iowa medical-cannabis cards have been denied foster placement or subjected to investigation solely for lawful medical participation.</p>
    <p>This initiative addresses those discrepancies by clarifying that lawful medical-cannabis use does not constitute child neglect, abuse, or endangerment. It establishes uniform standards for assessing impairment, requires consistent administrative interpretation, and calls on Iowa‚Äôs judiciary to recognize lawful use as protected medical conduct. The proposal also integrates perinatal and postnatal patient protections to ensure that pregnant and breastfeeding patients are treated under the same standards of medical respect and confidentiality as other patients.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="policy-framework">
    <h2>Policy Framework</h2>
    <h3>1. Legislative Action</h3>
    <p>Adopt the <em>Family Integrity and Medical Cannabis Patient Protection Act</em>, which amends Iowa Code ¬ß124E by adding ¬ß124E.21A ‚Äî ‚ÄúProtection of Parental and Caregiver Rights.‚Äù This amendment establishes that lawful participation in the medical-cannabis program shall not, by itself, be used as evidence of unfitness or neglect.</p>

    <h3>2. Administrative Oversight</h3>
    <p>Iowa HHS shall issue interpretive guidance confirming that participation in the Iowa medical-cannabis program does not constitute ‚Äúillegal drug use‚Äù under Iowa administrative or juvenile law. The Department shall update policy manuals and provide annual training for social workers, case managers, and healthcare providers.</p>

    <h3>3. Judicial Consistency</h3>
    <p>The Iowa Supreme Court is encouraged to issue an administrative directive or opinion affirming that participation in Iowa‚Äôs medical-cannabis program shall not create a presumption of unfitness or neglect in any family-court or juvenile proceedings.</p>

    <h3>4. Public Awareness and Coalition Building</h3>
    <p>The Initiative promotes partnership with Iowa NORML, ACLU of Iowa, and the Iowa Harm Reduction Coalition to increase public awareness and assist affected families in navigating administrative challenges. Testimony-driven advocacy will ensure patient voices are represented in legislative hearings.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Pregnant patients registered under ¬ß124E shall not be presumed negligent or unfit for lawful therapeutic use consistent with medical advice.</li>
